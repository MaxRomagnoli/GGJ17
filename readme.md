# Global Game Jam 2017

## Theme: Waves

## Game
Unfortunately, we developed this game with friends remotely, so it is not "officially" in the global Game Jam, even if we respected all the rules and deadlines of the case.
Your task is to move a floating bottle, generating waves by clicking the screen. Inside the bottle there is a message written by a castaway that will lead him to safety if he reaches his destination. Beyond the obstacle of understanding the direction to take, the player must avoid rocks, sharks and whirlpools.
